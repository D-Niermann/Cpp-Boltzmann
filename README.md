# Cpp Boltzmann
## Implementation of a restricted Boltzmann Machine 
- Use of custom Matrix class 
- Testing operator overloading and pointer management


Turns out it is pretty slow if one doesn't use optimized methods, like e.g. the eigen library does, which was surprising to me.

I did not write the MNIST LOADER myself!
